### Project

Second project of the Odin Project Javascript Course. The aim of this project was to create a fully functional PvP Tic-Tac-Toe game with the addition of an optional assignment to create AI players.

In my case, I managed to create AI players with 4 varying difficulties. Those being: easy, medium, hard and impossible. However, I did not use a minimax algorithm. I was too far into the project and my own solution that I didn't want to switch to using the minimax algorithm, despite it most likely being a lot more efficient. To create the AI, I instead wrote a bestMove function in which every possible move was considered for with if-statements.
